These are the supplemental files for the article

The supplemental code is written in a literate code style in the form of
pweave documents, with .texw extension. Such a file represents code with
inline latex documentation, and it can converted into a python file with code
only or into a latex document with code highlighted and output included. The
commands to make these conversions are in the Makefile, and all source files
and output pdfs maybe obtained by running make (this requires the Python
package pweave to be installed). For convenience, the corresponding pdfs and
python files are provided in the pdf/ and py/ directories, respectively. The
code requires SageMath modules to be available to run.
